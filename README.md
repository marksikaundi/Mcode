## Documentation

This is a code along project where we code live on streams an Makeup Website using the following:
## Tech stack
- ReactJS (+ Context API, hooks and routing)
- TailwindCSS
- Axios
- Makeup API (REST)
- and probably some more things

You can find the streams on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/marksikaundi/), I usually stream Mon-Fri at 19:15 CEST, but if not then you can find me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/marksikaundi/)

Here is a list of recommended reading/watching material to help you kickstart this project with a bit of knowledge:

1. [Tailwind CSS 101](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/tailwindcss-from-zero-to-production)
2. [Flux: explanation about Store, Dispatcher, View and Action](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-introduction-to-the-flux-architectural-pattern-674ea74775c9/)


If some of the things are too complex, then don't worry! We're here to learn and grow together, feel free to ask question during the stream to help yourself and everyone else too! :heart:
